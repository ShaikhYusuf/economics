      <h2 class="section-title">The Importance of Infrastructure</h2>
      <p>
        Traditionally, islanders collected drinking water from mountain streams and carried it to their huts in vessels they fashioned. This limited productivity and created challenges during droughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address this, Able Fisher V devised a system of reservoirs, funded by Maxine Goodbank, enabling efficient water storage and usage. This infrastructure transformed the island's economy by improving farming and industry.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        <strong>Real-Life Example: The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)</strong><br>
        The TVA in the U.S., created in the 1930s, addressed flooding and lack of electricity, boosting agriculture, industry, and living standards in the Tennessee River Valley.

      <h2 class="section-title">Trade and Economic Growth</h2>
      <p>
        Trade flourished as the island exported goods and imported necessities. This mirrored comparative advantage, where islands specialized in what they did best.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        <strong>Real-Life Example: Global Trade in Electronics and Natural Resources</strong><br>
        Nations like China and South Korea export electronics while importing raw materials, benefiting from comparative advantage and fueling economic growth.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        <strong>Real-Life Example: Free Trade Agreements (FTA)</strong><br>
        Agreements like NAFTA eliminated tariffs, fostering efficient trade and economic growth by focusing on each country's strengths.

      <h2 class="section-title">Reality Check: Big vs. Little Economics</h2>
      <p>
        Infrastructure spending can boost economies but must balance costs and benefits. Poorly planned projects waste resources and hinder growth.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        <strong>Real-Life Example: The "Bridge to Nowhere"</strong><br>
        A costly and unnecessary bridge in Alaska became a symbol of wasteful government spending, highlighting the importance of productive infrastructure investments.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        <strong>Real-Life Example: The Privatization of the UKâ€™s Rail System</strong><br>
        The UK privatized its rail system in the 1990s, with mixed results. Private companies improved infrastructure but faced challenges in maintaining service quality.

      <h2 class="section-title">Protectionism vs. Free Trade</h2>
      <p>
        Trade barriers harm consumers by limiting access to affordable goods and reducing efficiency. Nations benefit by focusing on their competitive advantages.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        <strong>Real-Life Example: Tariffs on Steel</strong><br>
        U.S. steel tariffs raised costs for industries reliant on steel, hurting competitiveness and consumers while protecting inefficient industries.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        <strong>Real-Life Example: The U.S. Trade Deficit</strong><br>
        The U.S. struggles with a trade deficit due to challenges in manufacturing. Investing in competitive sectors can help address this imbalance.

      <h2 class="section-title">Takeaway</h2>
      <p>
        Infrastructure spending and trade policies are key to economic growth, but their success depends on careful planning and leveraging comparative advantages.
