      <h1>Lesson 14: The Hut Glut and the Housing Crisis</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson-section">
      <h2>The Scenario</h2>
      <p>
        The scenario in Chapter 14 closely mirrors the events leading up to the housing crisis that began in the United
        States in the early 2000s. Government-backed hut loans, financial institutions offering riskier loans, and
        speculative behavior leading to the "hut glut" reflect the dynamics that played out during the housing bubble
        and its eventual collapse.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson-section">
      <h2>Real-Life Examples and Parallels</h2>

      <div class="lesson-example">
        <h4>Government-Sponsored Enterprises and Guarantees</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Real-Life Example:</strong> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac<br>
          The creation of Finnie Mae and Fishy Mac to back hut loans is directly inspired by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
          two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that played a crucial role in the U.S. housing market. Like Finnie
          and Fishy, these organizations helped lower interest rates and increased the availability of loans,
          particularly subprime loans. By 2006, they dominated the mortgage market, contributing to the housing bubble.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="lesson-example">
        <h4>Low-Interest Rates and Risky Lending</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Real-Life Example:</strong> Subprime Mortgages<br>
          In the Usonian example, banks were encouraged to make riskier loans. Similarly, the explosion of subprime
          mortgages in the U.S. offered low-interest loans to individuals with poor credit histories. In 2006,
          approximately 20% of all mortgages were subprime, inflating the housing market artificially.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="lesson-example">
        <h4>Speculation and Over-Inflated Home Prices</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Real-Life Example:</strong> Housing Price Speculation<br>
          Just as islanders viewed huts as investments, many American homebuyers saw real estate as a guaranteed profit
          opportunity. This speculative behavior pushed housing prices beyond reasonable levels, detaching them from
          market fundamentals.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="lesson-example">
        <h4>The Role of Investment Funds and Mortgage-Backed Securities</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Real-Life Example:</strong> Mortgage-Backed Securities and CDOs<br>
          Investment firms created complex financial instruments like MBS and CDOs to profit from the housing boom.
          These instruments, tied to risky mortgages, became highly unstable when defaults increased, leading to massive
          financial losses.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="lesson-example">
        <h4>Tax Incentives and Policies that Distort Markets</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Real-Life Example:</strong> Tax Deductions for Mortgage Interest<br>
          Similar to the Usonian Senate's decision to allow tax-free profits from hut sales, the U.S. tax code provided
          strong incentives for homeownership through mortgage interest deductions. These policies encouraged borrowing
          and home purchasing, inflating the housing market further.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="lesson-example">
        <h4>The Bubble Bursts</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Real-Life Example:</strong> The 2008 Housing Crisis<br>
          Just as the island's hut market collapsed, the U.S. housing bubble burst. Over-leveraged homeowners, rising
          defaults, and the collapse of mortgage-backed securities led to the Great Recession, with widespread financial
          losses and unemployment.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="lesson-example">
        <h4>Denial and Misunderstanding of the Crisis</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Real-Life Example:</strong> Economic Pundits and Politicians<br>
          Similar to Usonian leaders downplaying risks, many economists and politicians insisted the housing market was
          stable. By the time the bubble burst, the damage was unavoidable, highlighting the dangers of ignoring warning
          signs.
