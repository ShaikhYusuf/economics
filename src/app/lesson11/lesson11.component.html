            <h2>Usonia’s Economic Crisis</h2>
            <p>
                Usonia's economy faced a dire crisis due to overproduction of Fish Reserve Notes, causing rampant
                inflation and economic instability. The senators turned to economist Ben Barnacle, who suggested
                increasing the circulation of Fish Reserve Notes, but the root issue was the lack of real backing for
                the currency.

                <h4>Example 1: Zimbabwe’s Hyperinflation</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>What Happened:</strong> Zimbabwe in the late 2000s experienced inflation of 89.7 billion
                    percent month-over-month due to excessive money printing. <br>
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> The collapse of the Zimbabwean dollar highlighted the dangers of unbacked
                    currency, similar to Usonia's plight.

            <h2>A Lifeline from Sinopia</h2>
            <p>
                The Sinopian ambassador proposed exchanging fresh fish for Fish Reserve Notes. This trade stabilized
                Usonia’s currency by introducing real goods into the economy, mirroring real-world examples of trade
                balances and currency reserves.

                <h4>Example 2: U.S. Dollar as a Global Reserve Currency</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>What Happened:</strong> Many countries hold U.S. dollars as reserves to stabilize their
                    economies. <br>
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> This reliance on the U.S. dollar ensures global trade stability but also
                    highlights dependence on a single reserve currency.

            <h2>Sinopia’s Economic Transformation</h2>
            <p>
                Sinopia transitioned to a market-driven economy, allowing citizens to keep the fish they caught. This
                incentivized production and mirrored the real-world shift from centrally planned economies to
                capitalism.

                <p>
                    <strong>What Happened:</strong> China moved from a state-controlled economy to a market-oriented
                    system in the 1970s, driving significant growth. <br>
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> The introduction of private ownership and incentives spurred innovation and
                    industrial development.

                <p>
                    <strong>What Happened:</strong> The Soviet Union’s transition to market economies in the 1990s led
                    to an explosion of entrepreneurship. <br>
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> The shift to capitalism demonstrated the importance of personal incentives
                    for economic growth.

            <h2>Debt-Fueled Growth</h2>
            <p>
                Usonia’s reliance on Fish Reserve Notes to fund its economy parallels modern debt-fueled economies.
                While borrowing can drive growth, over-reliance poses significant risks.

                <h4>Example 5: U.S. Trade Deficits and Borrowing</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>What Happened:</strong> The U.S. has financed consumption through borrowing, primarily from
                    countries like China. <br>
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> This borrowing enables low interest rates but creates vulnerabilities if
                    foreign creditors demand higher returns.
