            <h4>What Happened:</h4>

        <div class="lesson-example">
            <h4>What Happened:</h4>
            <p>
                The government injected capital into banks during the 2008 financial crisis to prevent a system-wide collapse.

            <h4>Impact:</h4>
            <p>
                While stabilizing the economy temporarily, critics argue these bailouts rewarded failed institutions.
