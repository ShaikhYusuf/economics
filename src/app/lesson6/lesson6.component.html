            <h2>The Problem of Savings and Theft</h2>
            <p>
                As the islanders accumulated more fish, storage became a logistical nightmare. Storing fish in huts was
                inefficient and exposed them to theft. This is analogous to how economies face problems when savings
                outpace the available methods for safeguarding or efficiently utilizing those savings.

                <h4>Example 1: Banking System Evolution in the U.S.</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>What Happened:</strong> In the early 19th century, banks were established in the U.S. to
                    handle increasing amounts of savings and to prevent fraud. <br>
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> The creation of banks allowed for more secure storage of deposits and
                    helped stabilize the financial system, making it easier for the economy to grow.

                <p>
                    <strong>What Happened:</strong> The rise of digital banking has solved the problem of secure savings
                    for millions. <br>
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> Today, digital banks ensure the safety of deposits through encryption and
                    other security technologies, preventing theft and fraud while offering services that maximize the
                    utility of savings.

            <h2>The Birth of Goodbank</h2>
            <p>
                Max Goodbank recognized that individuals lacked the time and expertise to judge the merits of various
                investments. He saw an opportunity to create a centralized institution that could safely store savings
                and lend money to others who needed it.
            </p>
            <div class="lesson-example">
                <h4>Example 3: The Creation of Central Banks</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>What Happened:</strong> The Bank of England was established to manage national debt and
                    secure savings, thus contributing to the stability of the financial system. <br>
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> By centralizing banking operations, the Bank of England helped fund
                    government projects and manage economic growth, mirroring Max Goodbank's role in organizing the
                    island's finances.

                <h4>Example 4: Peer-to-Peer Lending</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>What Happened:</strong> Modern peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms like LendingClub and
                    Prosper have democratized lending by allowing individuals to lend money to others without the
                    intervention of traditional banks. <br>
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> These platforms serve as an alternative to banks, facilitating loans while
                    offering better interest rates for both borrowers and lenders.

            <h2>Interest Rates and the Profit Motive</h2>
            <p>
                Max set up his bank with an understanding of the importance of balancing the interests of borrowers and
                depositors. By offering loans at varying interest rates depending on the risk involved, and paying
                depositors interest for leaving their fish in the vault, he maximized the efficiency of capital
                distribution.

                <h4>Example 5: The Role of Interest Rates in the Housing Market</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>What Happened:</strong> In the 2000s, low interest rates led to a housing boom as consumers
                    could afford higher mortgages. <br>
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> While initially, this increased economic activity, it also led to the 2008
                    financial crisis when many borrowers defaulted, showing the dangers of too-low interest rates.

                <h4>Example 6: Japan’s Zero Interest Rate Policy</h4>
                <p>
                    <strong>What Happened:</strong> The Bank of Japan lowered interest rates to near zero to stimulate
                    the economy after a long period of stagnation. <br>
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> While this policy was intended to promote borrowing and spending, it has
                    also led to an extended period of low inflation and limited economic growth, illustrating the risks
                    of prolonged low rates.

            <h2>Risk Management in Banking</h2>
            <p>
                Max was cautious about taking on risky loans and focused on conservative, low-risk lending. He avoided
                funding speculative ventures, choosing instead to lend to borrowers with solid plans. This reflects the
                core principle of risk management in financial institutions.

                <p>
                    <strong>What Happened:</strong> Warren Buffett, known for his risk-averse approach, has avoided
                    investing in speculative ventures, focusing instead on businesses with stable earnings and
                    predictable growth. <br>
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> His philosophy has led to consistent long-term growth in his company,
                    Berkshire Hathaway, proving that careful risk management leads to sustained prosperity.

                <p>
                    <strong>What Happened:</strong> Banks and financial institutions took on high-risk subprime
                    mortgages, lending to borrowers with poor credit histories. <br>
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> The crisis showed how reckless lending practices can lead to widespread
                    economic damage, making a case for Max's cautious approach to lending.
