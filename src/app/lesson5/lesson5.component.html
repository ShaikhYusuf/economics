      <h1>Lesson 5: Prosperity Loves Company</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson-section">
      <h2>Productivity Leads to Prosperity</h2>
      <p>
        Productivity is the foundation of prosperity. When Able, Baker, and Charlie used their tools efficiently, they
        could produce more surplus fish than ever before. This surplus allowed them to focus on innovation and
        collaboration, driving the community's growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Increased productivity ensures that resources are used optimally, creating more opportunities for everyone
        involved.
      </p>
      <div class="lesson-example">
        <h4>Real-life Example:</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Industrial Revolution:</strong> The introduction of machines and assembly lines increased production
          rates, reduced costs, and led to the growth of economies worldwide.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson-section">
      <h2>Specialization Creates Efficiency</h2>
      <p>
        Specialization allows individuals or groups to focus on tasks they are best at, improving efficiency. On the
        island, Able focused on building tools, Baker on fishing, and Charlie on distributing resources. This division
        of labor enabled them to achieve more collectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specialization leads to expertise, ensuring better outcomes in less time.
      </p>
      <div class="lesson-example">
        <h4>Real-life Example:</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Medical Specialization:</strong> Surgeons, pediatricians, and general practitioners each focus on
          specific areas, ensuring patients receive expert care tailored to their needs.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson-section">
      <h2>The Power of Collaboration</h2>
      <p>
        Collaboration fosters innovation and resource sharing. The trio pooled their resources to create advanced tools
        and systems, such as a shared storage facility for their surplus fish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working together allows individuals to leverage each other's strengths and overcome challenges more effectively.
      </p>
      <div class="lesson-example">
        <h4>Real-life Example:</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Open-Source Projects:</strong> Platforms like Linux and GitHub thrive because developers worldwide
          collaborate, sharing knowledge and building robust software solutions.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson-section">
      <h2>Innovation as a Catalyst</h2>
      <p>
        Innovation transforms communities by introducing new tools and methods. On the island, the creation of advanced
        fishing gear significantly reduced labor while increasing productivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Supporting innovation ensures continuous progress and adaptability in a changing world.
      </p>
      <div class="lesson-example">
        <h4>Real-life Example:</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Technology Advancements:</strong> The rise of smartphones revolutionized communication, making
          information and services accessible to billions of people.
        </p>
