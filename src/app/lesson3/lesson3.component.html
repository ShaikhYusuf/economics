    <h2>Productive Business Loans</h2>
    <p>
      At the heart of economic growth are business loans that expand production. Able’s loan to Baker and Charlie to
      help them build fishing nets is an example of a productive business loan. These types of loans typically help
      individuals and businesses increase their capacity to produce goods and services, which benefits society by
      enhancing overall productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as mentioned in the text, there’s a risk involved. Not every business venture will succeed, and in the
      case where Baker and Charlie fail to produce effective fishing nets, the loan may be wasted, which leads to a loss
      of saved resources.
    </p>
    <div class="lesson-example">
      <h4>Real-life Example:</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Startups and Venture Capital:</strong> When investors like venture capitalists (VCs) provide funding to
        a startup, they are taking a risk. The startup may succeed and create a product or service that benefits
        society, or it may fail, resulting in the loss of the investment.

    <h2>Consumption Loans</h2>
    <p>
      A consumption loan is different from a business loan in that it’s used for immediate consumption rather than for
      expanding productive capacity. For example, if Able had lent Baker and Charlie fish to take a vacation, it would
      be a consumption loan.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Able may receive the interest on such a loan, there’s no increase in the productive capacity of the island.
      After the vacation, Baker and Charlie would still only be able to catch one fish per day.
    </p>
    <div class="lesson-example">
      <h4>Real-life Example:</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Personal Loans for Consumption:</strong> A consumer loan is often used to purchase goods or services
        that do not directly increase a person’s ability to generate income. For example, taking out a loan to buy a car
        for personal use may make life more convenient but doesn’t lead to increased income generation.
      </p>

  <div class="lesson-section">
    <h2>The Dangers of Consumption Loans</h2>
    <p>
      The chapter also warns against loans that don’t expand productive capacity, like the vacation loan Baker and
      Charlie request. While such loans may seem harmless, they can result in hardship if the borrower is unable to
      repay the loan.
    </p>
    <div class="lesson-example">
      <h4>Real-life Example:</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Government Bailouts and Subsidies:</strong> Government bailouts and subsidies are sometimes given to
        businesses or sectors that are struggling, but these often fail to lead to long-term improvements in the
        economy.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="lesson-section">
    <h2>Emergency Loans</h2>
    <p>
      An emergency loan is a type of loan given in a crisis to maintain basic survival, such as when Baker and Charlie
      fall ill due to the Pokalani Pox. Emergency loans serve a crucial role in preventing the collapse of society’s
      productive capacity.
    </p>
    <div class="lesson-example">
      <h4>Real-life Example:</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Disaster Relief and Emergency Loans:</strong> After natural disasters, governments and financial
        institutions often offer emergency loans to affected individuals or businesses. For instance, after Hurricane
        Katrina in 2005, the U.S. government provided emergency loans to businesses and homeowners in New Orleans to
        help them rebuild.

    <h2>The Reality Check: Can Credit Be Expanded?</h2>
    <p>
      A critical point raised in the chapter is whether credit can be expanded by simply increasing the amount of money
      available. In the case of Able’s fishing business, he can only lend as much fish as he has saved.
    </p>
    <div class="lesson-example">
      <h4>Real-life Example:</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Quantitative Easing:</strong> In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, central banks around the
        world engaged in quantitative easing (QE). While QE increased the money supply, it didn’t automatically result
        in more productive investment.

  <div class="lesson-section">
    <h2>The Role of Government in Allocating Credit</h2>
    <p>
      Governments often intervene in the credit market by offering guarantees, subsidies, and incentives for certain
      types of loans. However, such interventions can distort the allocation of resources.
    </p>
    <div class="lesson-example">
      <h4>Real-life Example:</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Student Loans and Housing Market:</strong> The U.S. government has provided subsidies and guarantees for
        student loans and home mortgages. While these policies have increased access to education and home ownership,
        they have also contributed to student debt crises and housing bubbles.
