      <h2>Survival on the Island</h2>
      <p>
        Let’s take a step back in time to a small, isolated island where three men—Able, Baker, and Charlie—are simply surviving.
        Picture it: a world where the only thing they have to eat is fish, and the only way to catch it is by jumping into the water and grabbing the fish by hand.
        Every day is a struggle for survival, and every fish caught is a precious meal.
        Their existence revolves around this repetitive, tiring cycle of waking up, fishing, eating, and sleeping.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>The Need for Change</h2>
      <p>
        Though life on the island is simple, the three men are not without ambition. They want more than just survival.
        Able, in particular, dreams of a better life—a life beyond the repetitive task of fishing by hand.
        He imagines creating better clothes, building a shelter, and even one day making feature films.
        But how could any of this happen when fishing alone consumes all of his time?
      </p>
      <p>
        One night, as Able gazes up at the stars, he wonders if there is a way to escape the monotony and achieve his dreams.
        And then, like a spark in the dark, an idea begins to take shape.
        What if there were a way to catch more fish in less time?
        What if he could create a tool—a device that would expand his reach and make fishing less physically demanding?
      </p>
      <p>
        The Net—Able’s brilliant invention—is born.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Innovation and Risk</h2>
      <p>
        Able’s net is not just a tool; it is a symbol of innovation and progress. By sacrificing today’s meal to work on his invention,
        Able is under-consuming—delaying his immediate need for food in hopes of achieving greater rewards in the future.
        This is a risky endeavor, because there is no guarantee that the net will work.
        He is trading his current needs for a possible future benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
        In economic terms, this is what we call capital—a tool that is made not to satisfy immediate desires, but to help create more goods or services in the future.
        Able doesn’t need the net for its own sake; he needs it to help him catch more fish.
        The net, therefore, is an investment—a tool for increasing his productivity and, ultimately, improving his standard of living.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>From Skepticism to Success</h2>
      <p>
        At first, Baker and Charlie laugh at Able’s strange new device. They doubt it will work and think he is wasting his time.
        But Able, undeterred, presses on. When the net is finally complete, he takes it out for a test run.
        At first, he struggles, but soon, he catches a fish—and not just any fish, but two fish in one day.
        This is a monumental achievement!
      </p>
      <p>
        This is where the magic happens. Able has doubled his productivity. While he once caught only one fish a day, now he can catch two.
        This newfound productivity doesn’t just benefit him; it benefits everyone.
        Able now has extra fish—savings—and with that, the potential for future growth.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>From Survival to Prosperity</h2>
      <p>
        Able’s ability to catch more fish means he can consume more and still have extra resources.
        This extra production is crucial for economic growth. It’s what allows him to move beyond mere survival and start thinking about other projects—like making clothes or building a shelter.
        In fact, his productivity has opened up a whole new world of possibilities.
        With more time and more resources, Able can now focus on improving his quality of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the essence of economic growth: the ability to produce more with less effort and then use those extra resources to improve living standards.
        The island’s economy is no longer just about surviving from day to day; it is about creating a better future through innovation and risk-taking.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>The Role of Tools</h2>
      <p>
        Able’s story highlights the fundamental role tools play in economic growth.
        Without tools like nets, shovels, and spears, humans would be stuck at the level of basic survival.
        These tools magnify human effort and make it possible to produce more than what is immediately needed.
        With the invention of the net, Able can now work more efficiently, which in turn allows him to have more than enough fish for himself—and even more for his friends.
      </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Innovation Drives Growth</h2>
      <p>
        This chapter illustrates a key lesson in economics: the growth of an economy is not about getting more resources; it’s about finding better ways to use the resources we already have.
        The net is not just a fishing tool; it is a symbol of human ingenuity, a reflection of how creative ideas can solve problems and lead to greater productivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through innovation, people can transform their surroundings, make life easier, and create more value for everyone.
        Whether it’s a new tool, a better technique, or a bold idea, innovation is the driving force that propels economies forward.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>The Takeaway</h2>
      <p>
        The most important lesson from Chapter 1 is clear: innovation creates abundance. When humans come up with new ideas or improve existing tools, they unlock new possibilities.
        These innovations enable us to produce more, which leads to savings, improvements in living standards, and prosperity for all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Able’s net might have started as a simple tool to catch more fish, but it is much more than that—it is the first step toward economic growth, the birth of a future where more is possible than ever before.
