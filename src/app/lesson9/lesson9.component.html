      <h2 class="section-title">Expanded Summary with Real-Life Examples</h2>
      <p>
        In Chapter 9, we explore the story of an island economy that begins with balanced principles of business growth, savings, and modest government interference, leading to prosperity. However, as the government grows and demands more revenue, the island's economy shifts towards greater intervention, ultimately resulting in instability. This mirrors the challenges faced by real-world economies transitioning from sound fiscal policies to inflationary approaches.

      <h2 class="section-title">The Island Economy's Early Success</h2>
      <p>
        Initially, the island economy thrives through free markets, low taxes, and light regulation. This is a classic example of classical economics at work, where businesses grow, prices fall, and wages rise in a self-sustaining cycle. This period of prosperity mirrors the post-World War II economic booms in Western countries, particularly the U.S. and Western Europe.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        <strong>Real-Life Example: The Post-War U.S. Economic Boom</strong><br>
        From 1945–1973, the U.S. experienced rapid growth, stable prices, and rising living standards. Policies like the GI Bill, which supported education and home loans for soldiers, helped the economy thrive. Low taxes, light regulation, and pro-business policies enabled industries and families to flourish.

      <h2 class="section-title">The Introduction of Fish Reserve Notes</h2>
      <p>
        A political leader, Franky Deep, proposes a reconstruction program after a monsoon disaster but lacks the funds to support it. He introduces Fish Reserve Notes, a currency backed by reserves the government doesn't actually possess. This mirrors inflationary monetary systems where money is printed without backing.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        <strong>Real-Life Example: The U.S. Abandons the Gold Standard</strong><br>
        In the early 1970s, President Nixon took the U.S. off the gold standard, allowing the Federal Reserve to print money without gold reserves. This contributed to dollar devaluation and inflation, as seen during the stagflation of the 1970s.

      <h2 class="section-title">Government Deficit Spending and Fake Currency</h2>
      <p>
        Franky Deep begins creating "official fish" from discarded fish parts to sustain the illusion of value. This mirrors real-world practices of monetary expansion, where unbacked currency erodes purchasing power.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        <strong>Real-Life Example: Zimbabwe's Hyperinflation</strong><br>
        In the 2000s, Zimbabwe printed large amounts of money to cover deficits, causing hyperinflation. By 2008, inflation reached 89.7 billion percent per month, eroding the value of the currency and collapsing the economy.

      <h2 class="section-title">The Creation of the Fish Deposit Insurance Corporation</h2>
      <p>
        To prevent a bank run, the government establishes the Fish Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). However, the FDIC is used to mask the currency's devaluation, much like real-world systems designed to protect deposits.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        <strong>Real-Life Example: The U.S. FDIC</strong><br>
        Created during the Great Depression, the FDIC insures deposits to maintain confidence in the banking system. However, critics argue that it encourages banks to take excessive risks, leading to financial instability.

      <h2 class="section-title">The Island Economy’s Collapse</h2>
      <p>
        Despite warnings from Max Goodbank, the government continues its fraudulent practices. As the currency loses value, the economy collapses, and Max is silenced. This mirrors real-world crises caused by political mismanagement of financial systems.
      </p>
      <p class="example">
        <strong>Real-Life Example: Venezuela's Economic Collapse</strong><br>
        Venezuela's government printed money to cover deficits, leading to hyperinflation, mass poverty, and economic collapse, mirroring the island’s downfall.

      <p>
        This chapter highlights the dangers of unchecked government intervention, currency manipulation, and deficit spending. Real-world examples like Zimbabwe and Venezuela illustrate how inflationary policies erode trust in money, wipe out savings, and lead to economic collapse.
