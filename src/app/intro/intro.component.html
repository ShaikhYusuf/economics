    <h2>1. Contrast Between Scientific Progress and Economics</h2>
    <p>
      Other sciences, like physics and engineering, have advanced with practical and predictive accuracy,
      while economics lags behind.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>
        In 2007, the global financial crisis caught most economists off guard, similar to a poorly calculated
        spacecraft missing its orbit and crashing.

  <section class="section">
    <h2>2. Keynesian Economics vs. Austrian Economics</h2>

    <!-- Keynesianism -->
    <div class="subsection">
      <h3>Keynesianism’s Appeal</h3>
      <p>
        Keynesian policies offer "pain-free" solutions like printing money or running deficits to stimulate growth.
        However, these often lead to long-term problems like inflation.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Example:</strong> During the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments used stimulus measures
          to provide relief, which led to inflationary pressures.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Austrian Economics -->
    <div class="subsection">
      <h3>The Austrian Approach</h3>
      <p>
        Focuses on addressing the root causes of economic instability and avoiding artificial booms created by
        low-interest rates and loose monetary policies.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Example:</strong> The dot-com bubble of the early 2000s was fueled by speculative investments
          driven by low-interest rates, which eventually burst.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Section: The Role of Gold and Fiat Money -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>3. The Role of Gold and Fiat Money</h2>
    <p>
      The shift from a gold-backed currency to fiat money has led to inflation and economic instability.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Example</h3>
      <p>
        After the U.S. abandoned the gold standard in 1971, inflation surged. The 1970s oil crisis quadrupled gas prices
        and reduced the purchasing power of money.
      </p>

  <!-- Section: Irwin Schiff and The Fish Story -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>4. Irwin Schiff and The Fish Story</h2>
    <p>
      Irwin Schiff used simple allegories like "The Fish Story" to explain economic principles like savings, investment,
      and productivity.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Key Message</h3>
      <p>
        The story of three men on an island illustrates how innovation and cooperation lead to economic growth.
        It shows the importance of surplus production and the creation of tools for productivity.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- Section: Flaws of Keynesianism -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>5. The Flaws of Keynesianism</h2>
    <p>
      Keynesian policies often provide short-term relief at the cost of long-term consequences like inflation and debt.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>2008 Financial Crisis:</strong> Low-interest rates and government policies created a housing bubble,
        leading to an economic collapse.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Modern Inflation (2020s):</strong> Trillions of dollars printed during the COVID-19 pandemic caused inflation
        that eroded purchasing power.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Section: Hope for Clarity -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>6. Hope for Clarity</h2>
    <p>
      The book advocates for straightforward principles and emphasizes that nations, like individuals, cannot spend
      their way to prosperity.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      <h3>Real-Life Insight</h3>
      <p>
        A family that overspends using credit cards faces collapse. Similarly, nations that print excessive money
        risk hyperinflation, as seen in Venezuela.
