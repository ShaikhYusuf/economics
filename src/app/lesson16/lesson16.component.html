            <h1>Lesson 16: The Great Hut Rut and Usonia's Economic Troubles</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson-section">
            <h2>Economic Response to the Crisis</h2>
            <p>
                The economy of Usonia is faltering. Despite earlier efforts, including bailouts and stimulus packages,
                economic activity remains sluggish, especially in the hut-buying sector.
            </p>
            <p>
                The public chooses to save rather than spend, and government assistance has not been effective in
                spurring meaningful growth. Cart companies and construction industries are on the brink of collapse.
            </p>
            <p>
                In response, Barry Ocuda, the new Senator-in-Chief, is elected on a platform of radical economic
                transformation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson-section">
            <h2>Ocuda's Economic Reforms</h2>
            <p>
                Ocuda's solution is to massively expand government intervention:
            </p>
            <ul class="lesson-takeaways">
                <li>Increase subsidies for hut buyers, including trade-up buyers, and lower interest rates for loans.
                </li>
                <li>Stimulate education through increased funding for surfing schools and student loans.</li>
                <li>Initiate public works projects like the Shady Swamp lighthouse to provide jobs.</li>
                <li>Push for a transition to llama-based infrastructure, including llama breeding, cart redesigns, and
                    path resurfacing.</li>
                <li>Introduce the "Carp for Carts" program to incentivize replacing old carts with more fuel-efficient
                    ones.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson-section">
            <h2>Reality Check: Ineffective Government Spending</h2>
            <p>
                While Ocuda's initiatives stimulate short-term activity, such as job creation and increased sales of
                goods, they fail to expand the economy's productive capacity sustainably.
            </p>
            <p>
                The diversion of labor and resources to government-funded projects undermines the market’s ability to
                allocate resources efficiently. Without addressing the fundamental issue of low productivity, these
                policies create an illusion of recovery while not solving the long-term problems.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson-section">
            <h2>The Issue of Foreign Debt</h2>
            <p>
                Usonia is out of fish, meaning its economy relies on foreign borrowing to fund new expenditures. The
                country consumes more than it produces, forcing the government to borrow from abroad to finance its
                deficits.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reliance on foreign lending, particularly from Sinopia, introduces significant risks. At some point,
                foreign creditors may stop buying Usonian debt, triggering an economic crisis.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson-section">
            <h2>The Sinopian Dilemma</h2>
            <p>
                Sinopia, Usonia's creditor, faces its own economic problems. The hardworking Sinopians save money due to
                their minimal social safety net, preparing for future hardships.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Sinopian king, whose country depends on Usonian demand for goods, faces a dilemma: continue buying
                Fish Reserve Notes to support Usonia's economy, or stop and risk devaluing those notes, undermining
                their purchasing power.
            </p>
            <div class="lesson-example">
                <h4>The Peasant's Wisdom</h4>
                <p>
                    A peasant advises the king to stop giving away real goods in exchange for Fish Reserve Notes and
                    focus on domestic trade. This wisdom resonates with the king, who decides to focus on Sinopia's
                    economy instead of financing Usonian debt.
                </p>

        <div class="lesson-section">
            <h2>Conclusion: The Usonian Economic Outlook</h2>
            <p>
                Usonia's economic problems temporarily eased due to stimulus programs, but these solutions failed to
                address the underlying structural issues. The government’s inability to confront its debt problem leaves
                the country vulnerable to a future economic crisis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Foreign creditors like Sinopia may eventually stop lending, leading to default or inflation as the
                inevitable consequences of unsustainable debt levels.
