      <h1>Lesson 4: Economic Expansion</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson-section">
      <h2>Economic Expansion Through Capital Investments</h2>
      <p>
        Capital investments play a pivotal role in driving economic expansion. When Able, Baker, and Charlie saved their
        surplus fish, they could focus on building tools like fishing nets or boats. These tools enhanced their
        productivity and allowed them to catch more fish with less effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        This demonstrates how saved resources can be used to create new tools and systems that make life more efficient
        and ensure sustainable growth.
      </p>
      <div class="lesson-example">
        <h4>Real-life Example:</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Infrastructure Development:</strong> Governments invest in building highways, bridges, and public
          transit systems. These investments reduce transportation costs and enhance trade, benefiting society as a
          whole.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson-section">
      <h2>Collaborative Ventures and Risk-Taking</h2>
      <p>
        Collaborative ventures often yield greater results than individual efforts. For example, Baker suggested pooling
        their savings to build a large fishing vessel. Although risky, such investments can lead to breakthroughs that
        benefit everyone involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, risk-taking should be calculated and informed. An unsuccessful venture could result in wasted resources
        and setbacks for all participants.
      </p>
      <div class="lesson-example">
        <h4>Real-life Example:</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Tech Startups:</strong> Companies like Google and Apple started as small collaborations. The founders
          took risks, pooling resources and ideas, which ultimately led to groundbreaking innovations.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson-section">
      <h2>Economic Buffers: The Importance of Savings</h2>
      <p>
        Savings act as a buffer during times of crisis. When natural disasters struck the island, Baker and Charlie were
        able to rebuild their tools because they had saved resources. Without those savings, they would have been left
        vulnerable and unable to recover quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        This emphasizes the importance of setting aside resources during good times to prepare for unforeseen challenges
        in the future.
      </p>
      <div class="lesson-example">
        <h4>Real-life Example:</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Emergency Funds:</strong> Individuals who save a portion of their income are better equipped to handle
          sudden expenses, like medical emergencies or job losses, without falling into debt.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson-section">
      <h2>The Pitfalls of Overconsumption</h2>
      <p>
        Overconsumption is a significant threat to long-term economic stability. If Able, Baker, and Charlie had
        consumed all their fish without saving, they would have been unable to invest in tools or rebuild after a
        disaster. This behavior leads to short-term enjoyment but long-term vulnerabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overconsumption often results from a lack of financial planning and an over-reliance on borrowed resources.
      </p>
      <div class="lesson-example">
        <h4>Real-life Example:</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Credit Card Debt:</strong> Many individuals fall into the trap of excessive spending using credit
          cards, accumulating debt that becomes difficult to repay. This cycle can lead to financial stress and
          instability.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="lesson-section">
      <h2>The Role of Innovation in Economic Growth</h2>
      <p>
        Innovation drives economic growth by creating new opportunities and increasing efficiency. On the island, the
        introduction of fishing nets and boats revolutionized their way of life, allowing them to produce more with
        fewer resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Encouraging innovation requires a supportive environment where individuals can experiment without fear of
        failure.
      </p>
      <div class="lesson-example">
        <h4>Real-life Example:</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Renewable Energy Solutions:</strong> Investments in solar and wind energy have not only reduced
          reliance on fossil fuels but have also created new industries and jobs.
