      "question": "How did the rise of speculative behavior affect the U.S. housing market?",
      "Answer": "Speculative behavior in the U.S. housing market led to inflated home prices as buyers expected prices to continue rising. This created a bubble, where people bought homes not for living but as investments, anticipating future profits. When the market crashed, the bubble burst, leading to widespread foreclosures and financial losses."
