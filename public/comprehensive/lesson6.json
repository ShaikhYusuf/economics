      "question": "What were the causes and consequences of the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis?",
      "Answer": "The 2008 subprime mortgage crisis was caused by reckless lending practices, where banks provided high-risk loans to borrowers who were unlikely to repay. When housing prices fell, many borrowers defaulted, leading to widespread foreclosures. This resulted in the collapse of major financial institutions, a global recession, and a severe economic downturn."
